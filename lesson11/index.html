            <h1>We Weren’t Prepared for Winter Weather</h1>
            <img src="images/home-article.jpg" alt="snow in bare trees">
            <p>“I think we have to make one more rock hunting trip before winter sets in,” my weekly rockhounding
                friend, Mike Bruton, suggested last Saturday as we met each other ice fishing on the Henrys Lake.
                “Weather does not look too bad for Wednesday but even though there may be a little moisture, we can go
                after that vein of opal that we found in September.”</p>

            <p>It would be our 17th trip of the summer into the mountains of central Idaho looking for beautiful and
                odd stones to make into cabochons for necklaces and other jewelry. Agates, jasper and petrified wood
                were our usual material that we had been hunting with an occasional trip for opal or crystals.</p>

            <p>The day before Thanksgiving we left early enough to join the daily migration of workers to the Idaho
                National Laboratory and by the time we got to Arco we had avoided playing bumper cars with the
                bumper-to-bumper traffic. Then as we drove through central Idaho we had another migration to go through.
                The antelope were crossing the road migrating from the high country to the harvested barren
                fields.</p>

            <p>Ten miles from our destination, snow started falling and we both chuckled because it was about six hours
                early. But we had the vein GPS’ed and a little snow would not deter us. The snow squall had quit by the
                time we were at the site but a quarter of an inch of the white covering changed everything and it took
                us 30 minutes to find the small vein. Even though we had picks and bars, chisels and hammers, we were
                not prepared for the frozen earth around the rock and the host rock containing the opal was very
                reluctant to give up the “good stuff.”</p>
